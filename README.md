# Harry-Potter-Fun

After learning about SQL and MVC, I wanted more practice using DALs to use practical database information on a functional webpage. I found a database full of Harry Potter characters and couldn't help but want to use it. 

My first step was to rearrange some of the data in the database tables, so that it would be more practical for use. From there I wanted to do two things:

1. Create a simple system to add or take away points from the Hogwarts Houses (based on which characters had earned or lost points for the House) and store the House Points in the database. 
2. Create a Class Registration page where students can sign up for classes at Hogwarts.
